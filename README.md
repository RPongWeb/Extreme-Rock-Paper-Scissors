# Extreme-Rock-Paper-Scissors
A modified version of the classic Rock Paper Scissor game. 

The CPU along with the user both start out with 5 rock , 5 paper , and 5 scissors. 
The objective of the game is to make the other player run out of their rock , paper , and scissors! 

If you play rock and the computer plays scissors , you win and therefore you will be able to take their scissor. 
If it is a draw , both parties get back their respective resources. 

Have Fun!
